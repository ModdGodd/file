also go to [my website homepage](https://moddgodd.github.io/homepage). I linked it just for you 
A place where I upload some assets; these are for my use, please don't use them without my permission. Its random stuff I wont spend really any time here <br>
**The directory is here:** 
### Anurati
Just comes in the one variant
| Font | Fontname (What you call it with) | Description |
| :--- | :----: | ---: |
| Standard, or Regular/Medium | 'Anurati' | It looks pretty modern. I reccoment use it very less; Usually, only CAPS looks good |
### Corbert
It will be very nice UI, I think its a nice blend of Sans and Serif. Downside is that the Bolded and normal versions are from different sources, and that makes them look different positioning which I cannot fix.
| Font | Fontname (What you call it with) | Description |
| :--- | :----: | ---: |
| Regular/Medium | 'Corbert' | Perfect UI font, its too modern to be a body typeface, but it is just behind Monteserrat, which is probably by now too overused.|
| Bolded | 'Corbert B' | Its a great font if its your style, I reccomend to set everything to it; the only catch was that font-weight and bold tags worked bad with the normal Corbert, so I had to dig out a bold version manually |
### Whitney
This font is a great one for just everything; It comes in 9 whole variants so it took me a long time to get it all compiled into this repo so it can be used similar to 
| Font | Fontname (What you call it with) | Description |
| :--- | :----: | ---: |
| Bolded | 'Whitney Bold' | For very strong and important texts, it looks great |
| Thin? | 'Whitney Book' | I am going to quit describing them about here... |
| thin italic | 'Whitney Book Italic' | Upside is this is an actual family, so using bold wont be messed up  like corbert up there... |
| the rest ill skip its self evident | 'Whitney Light Italic' |  |
|  | 'Whitney Light' |  |
|  | 'Whitney Medium Italic' |  |
|  | 'Whitney Medium' |  |
|  | 'Whitney Semibold Italic' |  |
|  | 'Whitney Semibold' |  |
